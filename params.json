{"name":"Star","tagline":"Star: a DIY tablet computer","body":"### The great Linux tablet is not available yet, so I have decided to build one\r\n\r\nI have for many years had a dream about having a Linux tablet without to many software lockins by manufacturers. I think that the best consumer electronics are hardware platforms that allows the user to choose the software. I finally decided to try this out.\r\n\r\nI don't know if this will be a success or not, I have some knowledge about electronics, Linux, metal/wood crafting and programming so I thought I would combine all those skills and ask other skilled people I know for help once in a while and just maybe this project will be a success. I also decided to write about it to help me keep track of the journey and share my thoughts.\r\n\r\n### The vision\r\n\r\nInitially I wanted to create an e ink tablet, but since it is still seem extremely hard to find a large display that is plug and play I settled for an LCD display.\r\n\r\nThe goal of the project is to create a portable tablet running a Linux desktop environment that I can use when surfing, reading, writing or doing some programming as well as a device whose hardware are expendable and upgradeable. While devices like Android tablets allows you to consume content and apps, I want this device to inspire creativity both in the sense that I can create new things with it as I would with a laptop but also inspire me to make modifications to the device itself.\r\n\r\nThe key features that I'm looking for:\r\n\r\n* Multi touch display\r\n* Long battery life\r\n* Fast enough to run Linux desktop environment\r\n* Internet connectivity\r\n* More portable and more than my 15\" ThinkPad\r\n* Wooden or at least some kind of more artistic shell (I also like to make/repair musical instruments)\r\n* Possibility to add I/O more hardware sensors as I go (I will add an Arduino inside since the ODROID I/O is only 1.8v)\r\n\r\nA very early sketch of how the device could look:\r\n\r\n![A very early sketch of the device](images/sketch.jpg)\r\n\r\n### Inspiration\r\n\r\nI like using low power computers like the Sheevaplug and Raspberry Pi for file servers and media players and so on. Now I want to try using one with a full desktop environment for working.\r\n\r\nI originally planned using a Raspberry Pi 2 as the computer but I found the ODROID-XU4 which although it draws more power and requires a fan is a lot faster than the Raspberry Pi 2.\r\n\r\nTwo projects that inspired me a lot are the [Raspberry Pi tablet](http://makezine.com/2014/01/07/how-i-built-a-raspberry-pi-tablet/) and the [Spark tablet](http://www.instructables.com/id/Spark-The-DIY-Modular-Tablet/?ALLSTEPS). They showed that this is possible. The computers used there are somewhat slower but also use less power consuming computers that does not require to try to create a custom PSU.\r\n\r\n### Parts\r\n\r\nThere are a lot of parts needed and I don't know which will work but I decided to order parts that I think will work together and I will try to complete with other parts later if needed.\r\n\r\nThis is a list of the electronics I plan to use:\r\n\r\n* Computer\r\n    * ODROID-XU4 8 core 2GB ram, 32GB eMMC for storage\r\n* Display\r\n    * 13.3\" 1920x1080 LCD\r\n    * 13.3\" Multi touch screen with USB controller\r\n    * LCD controller with HDMI output\r\n* Wireless\r\n    * 150 Mbit WiFi USB dongle\r\n    * Bluetooth 4.0 USB dongle\r\n    * Wireless mouse receiver\r\n* I/O fun\r\n    * Arduino\r\n* Power (was unable to find ready to use battery phone charger that could output 6A so decided to try to build a system)\r\n    * 8 Li ion cells (I don't know how many I will use yet)\r\n    * Li ion charger circuit for 2 serial cells (will use cells in two groups of four so I get 7.4v)\r\n    * 7.4v to 5v step down module for the ODROID\r\n    * 7.4v to 12v step up module for the LCD display\r\n    * Voltage and current sensors connected to the Arduino to see how much charge is left\r\n* External input devices (with solar panels so I don't need to charge those)\r\n    * iPad keyboard with Bluetooth and solar panel\r\n    * Wireless mouse with solar panel\r\n* Webcam and microphone (will be added later)\r\n\r\n#### Complete parts list so far (as named on eBay and Hardkernel stores)\r\n\r\n* ODROID-XU4\r\n* 32GB eMMC 5.0 Module XU3 / XU4 Linux\r\n* Mini USB 150M 150Mbps Wireless LAN Adapter 802.11b/n/g WiFi w/ 2dBi Antenna EC\r\n* 0.3M HDMI Cable V1.4 HD 3D 1080P Connector Gold Plated For PS3 LCD HDTV XBOX\r\n* 30A range Current Sensor Module ACS712 Module Arduino module NEW\r\n* Protection Circuit Module PCM for 2S 7.4V 7.2V Li-ion Li-Po Battery C:10A 2SW007\r\n* LM2587 DC-DC Boost Converter 3-30V Step up to 4-35V Power Supply Module MAX 5A\r\n* N133HSE-EA1 Rev C1 13.3\" LED LCD Screen WUXGA FHD IPS Laptop Display Panel Slim\r\n* 1pcs Standard Voltage Sensor Module For Robot Arduino\r\n* Mini USB Nano V3.0 ATmega328P CH340G 5V 16M Micro-controller board For Arduino\r\n* 5A Lithium Charger CV CC buck Step down Power Supply Module LED Driver z3\r\n* HDMI Female to Female Cable Extension Adapter Converter Connector for HDTV DH\r\n* 13.3\" Capacitive USB touch screen kit 307*183mm fit B133XW02 LTN133AT17 LP133WH1\r\n* 8pc 18650 UltraFire Li-ion 3.7V 6800mAh Red Rechargeable Battery For Flash Light\r\n* NEW AND HOT HIGH SPEED 4 PORT MINI USB HUB LAPTOP PC\r\n* 5A DC-DC adjustable step-down module XL4015 4~38V 96% NEW GOOD QUALITY M22\r\n* HDMI VGA DVI Audio Controller board 13.3\" N133HSE EA1 apply to driver board\r\n* Mini Solar Energy Charging 2.4GHz Optical Wireless Gaming Mouse for Desktop PC\r\n* Solar Powered Wireless Bluetooth Keyboard Stand Case for iPhone iPad2/3 Laptop\r\n* USB 2.0 Mini Wireless Bluetooth V4.0 V3.0 V2.0 Dongle Adapter for PC Laptop PDA","google":"UA-66818931-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
