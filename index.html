<p><img src="images/sketch.jpg" alt="A very early sketch of the device"></p>

<p>I have for many years had a dream about having a Linux tablet without to many software lockins by manufacturers. I think that the best consumer electronics are hardware platforms that allows the user to choose the software. I finally decided to try this out.</p>

<p>I don't know if this will be a success or not, I have some knowledge about electronics, Linux, metal/wood crafting and programming so I thought I would combine all those skills and ask other skilled people I know for help once in a while and just maybe this project will be a success. I also decided to write about it to help me keep track of the journey and share my thoughts.</p>

<h3>
<a id="the-vision" class="anchor" href="#the-vision" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The vision</h3>

<p>Initially I wanted to create an e ink tablet, but since it is still seem extremely hard to find a large display that is plug and play I settled for an LCD display.</p>

<p>The goal of the project is to create a portable tablet running a Linux desktop environment that I can use when surfing, reading, writing or doing some programming as well as a device whose hardware are expendable and upgradeable. While devices like Android tablets allows you to consume content and apps, I want this device to inspire creativity both in the sense that I can create new things with it as I would with a laptop but also inspire me to make modifications to the device itself.</p>

<p>The key features that I'm looking for:</p>

<ul>
<li>Multi touch display</li>
<li>Long battery life</li>
<li>Fast enough to run Linux desktop environment</li>
<li>Internet connectivity</li>
<li>More portable and more than my 15" ThinkPad</li>
<li>Wooden or at least some kind of more artistic shell (I also like to make/repair musical instruments)</li>
<li>Possibility to add I/O more hardware sensors as I go (I will add an Arduino inside since the ODROID I/O is only 1.8v)</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<a id="inspiration" class="anchor" href="#inspiration" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Inspiration</h3>

<p>I like using low power computers like the Sheevaplug and Raspberry Pi for file servers and media players and so on. Now I want to try using one with a full desktop environment for working.</p>

<p>I originally planned using a Raspberry Pi 2 as the computer but I found the ODROID-XU4 which although it draws more power and requires a fan is a lot faster than the Raspberry Pi 2.</p>

<p>Two projects that inspired me a lot are the <a href="http://makezine.com/2014/01/07/how-i-built-a-raspberry-pi-tablet/">Raspberry Pi tablet</a> and the <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Spark-The-DIY-Modular-Tablet/?ALLSTEPS">Spark tablet</a>. They showed that this is possible. The computers used there are somewhat slower but also use less power consuming computers that does not require to try to create a custom PSU.</p>

<h3>
<a id="parts" class="anchor" href="#parts" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Parts</h3>

<p>There are a lot of parts needed and I don't know which will work but I decided to order parts that I think will work together and I will try to complete with other parts later if needed.</p>

<p>This is a list of the electronics I plan to use:</p>

<ul>
<li>Computer

<ul>
<li>ODROID-XU4 8 core 2GB ram, 32GB eMMC for storage</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Display

<ul>
<li>13.3" 1920x1080 LCD</li>
<li>13.3" Multi touch screen with USB controller</li>

</li>
<li>Wireless

<ul>
<li>150 Mbit WiFi USB dongle</li>
<li>Bluetooth 4.0 USB dongle</li>
<li>Wireless mouse receiver</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I/O fun

<ul>
<li>Arduino</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Power (was unable to find ready to use battery phone charger that could output 6A so decided to try to build a system)

<ul>
<li>8 Li ion cells (I don't know how many I will use yet)</li>
<li>Li ion charger circuit for 2 serial cells (will use cells in two groups of four so I get 7.4v)</li>
<li>7.4v to 5v step down module for the ODROID</li>
<li>7.4v to 12v step up module for the LCD display</li>
<li>Voltage and current sensors connected to the Arduino to see how much charge is left</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>External input devices (with solar panels so I don't need to charge those)

<ul>
<li>iPad keyboard with Bluetooth and solar panel</li>
<li>Wireless mouse with solar panel</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Webcam and microphone (will be added later)</li>
</ul>
